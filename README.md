Dynamic Icons 
=============
Developed by Michael Ruane for the DVRPC Open Freight App using the IcoMoon App. In addition to custom icons developed by DVRPC, this set includes icons from the [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome#license) set and [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/#icons) set.

# Customizing Icon Sets
Dynamic Icons for Open Freight App were generated using the [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app/). The repo for these icons contains the necessary project file (`selection.json`) to upload to the app for modification and expansion of the original icon set.

There are a few simple steps for adding additional icons to the dynamic icon set. 

1. Download or clone the Dynamic Icons repo to a local file `git clone https://github.com/DVRPCfreight/dynamic-icons`
2. Navigate to IcoMoon App and select `Import Icons`
3. From the repo's directory upload the `selection.json` file.
4. Use the IcoMoon App to make the necessary changes to the icon set. More information on using this app is available in [the docs](https://icomoon.io/#docs). You have the option of selecting from a number of free icon sets or you can create you own SVG icons and add them to the set.
5. When you have finished and have downloaded a new icon font you can include the necessary files in the deployment of your application.
